# Javachain

## Overview

Javachain is a full-stack blockchain decentralized application that supports the creation of verifiable financial statements and business operations/accounting functions.  

Blockchain technology's unique selling proposition is decentralization.  This concept is primed to disrupt a number of industries.  In the context of business operations and accounting, one of the biggest challanges contractual parties face is trust.  In this instance, financial statements that can be relied upon. Financial statement auditing is one specific area where blockchain has the potential to completely reshape the process.  Javachain is our take on how Ethereum and distributed ledger technology might be utilized to facilitate the creation and maintenance of financial statements and business transactions.

Javachain utilizes the Ethererum framework, smart contracts, and ERC777 tokenization to create a way that accounting transactions can be recorded and compiled into financial statements via a distributed ledger.  Financial statement accounts are assigned addresses and ECR777 tokens are minted to an address representing the business owner (owner's equity) upon deployment.  Individual functions within the smart contract represent common journal entries, which send tokens ('Javacoin') representing cash to the appropriate account addresses.  The business owner or accountant (contract deployer) enters transactions and journal entries into the app, which are subsequently recorded on the blockchain once consensus is achieved. 

Additionally, specific business operations functions can also take advantage of the blockchain.  As part of a "bonus pack", this app has smart contract functionality to support payroll processing and executing a lease agreement with a landlord.  

## Business Development Process

1.	Research what the big 4 accounting firms have been saying on this.
2.	Blockchain Accounting for Business: decide what business transactions that we want to support
  a.	Investment in a business from an owner (cash and owners equity).
  b.	Purchase of assets (goods, inventory).
  c.	Employee Cost.
  d.	Sales of goods on cash.
3.	Set the data we want to store on the blockchain (ie, what needs to be debited and credited for each transaction, uri of supporting docs).
4.	Write the smart contracts that support business transactions
5.	Establish the business and its accounting records for 1 year and run through the smart contracts. Use Ganache.
6.	Deploy to Github pages with a good user interface. *** As the deliverable *** 
7.	Establish a token that offers access to financial statements that can be given to  a bank or investor or represents investment in the business / economics or voting interest.
8.	See if we could distribute among our four computers.
