## Business Development Process

1.	Research what the big 4 accounting firms have been saying on this.
2.	Blockchain Accounting for Business: decide what business transactions that we want to support
a.	Investment in a business from an owner (cash and owners equity).
b.	Purchase of assets (goods, inventory).
c.	Employee Cost.
d.	Sales of goods on cash.
3.	Set the data we want to store on the blockchain (ie, what needs to be debited and credited for each transaction, uri of supporting docs).
4.	Write the smart contracts that support business transactions
5.	Establish the business and its accounting records for 1 year and run through the smart contracts. Use Ganache.
6.	Deploy to Github pages with a good user interface. *** As the deliverable *** 
7.	Establish a token that offers access to financial statements that can be given to  a bank or investor or represents investment in the business / economics or voting interest.
8.	See if we could distribute among our four computers.
